How does d update?


#= Calculate size of state
h, a ∈ [0,max_fork]
s ∈ [0, 2015]
d ∈ [300 * hashrate/C, 2 * 600*hashrate/C] Maybe set max to 2 times max(expected)
w ∈ [0, dmax * 600 * no_of_blocks / 4]
d adjustment cannot be more than 4 of less than 1/4
Just set the hashrate very small, that downscales the problem
NOTE: potential bug in w
Dmax = 600*h/C
time = DmaxC/h
time = (600*h/C) * C / h = 600
